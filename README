This repository contains a useful collection of Scheme libraries written in R7RS.

Run Tests
---------

Assuming you have Chibi Scheme installed, you can run the tests by issuing
the command

  chibi-scheme tests.scm

in the main directory. The test suite should work as well with any other
R7RS-compliant implementation of the Scheme programming language although
the exact command-line syntax may differ.

Libraries
---------

  - (rapid boxes): A SRFI-111 compatible implementation of mutable cells
  - (rapid list): A rudiment of a SRFI-1 compatible implementation of list procedures
  - (rapid generators): A rudiment of a SRFI-121 compatible implementation of generators
  - (rapid test): A SRFI-64 compatible implementation of a Scheme testing
    framework based on the original implementation by Per Bothner
